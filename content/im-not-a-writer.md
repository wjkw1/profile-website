This is the way.

I take a structured approach to writing, where I figure out the structure and message of what I want to convey. I tend to struggle fleshing out each section, it all feels a bit fluffy to me.

ChatGPT / Bard / Bing Chat has enabled me to unlearn that feeling by both:

- Fleshing out each section
- Summarising overloaded sentences
- Ideation

I don't like to write. Eventually when writing get writers block and become paralysed by deciding what words to use.
