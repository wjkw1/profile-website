I don't consider myself a writer. One, I don't write enough and two, I don't think my writing is a high enough standard (internally) that I'd be happy to label myself a writer.

I take a structured approach to writing, where I figure out the structure and message of what I want to convey. I tend to struggle fleshing out each section, it all feels a bit fluffy to me.

ChatGPT / Bard / Bing Chat has enabled me to unlearn that feeling by both:

- Fleshing out each section
- Summarising overloaded sentences
- Ideation

I don't like to write. Eventually when writing get writers block and become paralysed by deciding what words to use.
