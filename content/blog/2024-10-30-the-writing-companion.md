The way I write has evolved, primarily due to a shift in my relationship with AI and the writing process itself:

- **Before**: I used AI to generate content
- **Now**: I use AI more as a refinement tool and writing companion

When referring to AI in this post, I specifically mean large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Perplexity.

## Before

How I worked with AI in the past is silly. Using AI to generate content makes the writing sound generic and peppered with buzzwords that people never use. I mean, check the title and content of my last blog posts: ['Unleashing the Writer Within: How ChatGPT Transformed My Writing'](/blog/2023-11-6-im-not-a-writer), and ['Supercharge Your SSH with VS Code'](/blog/2023-10-29-ssh-using-vscode). 🫣

AI generated content has telltale signs when you see words like: unleashed, supercharge, delve, crucial, [more examples here](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/07/the-telltale-words-that-could-identify-generative-ai-text/). The silver lining is that AI taught me more words - the problem is these new words didn't feel authentic to me.

Using AI to generate content was also a coping mechanism to my creative blocks. An unfortunate consequence was that it removed my "want to think", I could feel myself leaning more and more on the information provided by AI. This felt similar to defaulting to a calculator instead of doing mental math.

It's been over a year since I published those blogs, and I've been using AI —[perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)— a lot differently since I started...

## Now

Firstly, a bit of background, I work in tech for Xero and I've met so many awesome people there. Luckily for me, I've got a mentor who is a fantastic Engineer and an amazing Writer, seriously, it's their superpower; and I've been heavily influenced by them. Their guidance has helped me to structure my thoughts more clearly and to approach writing with more confidence.

They shared with me [this amazing blog](https://www.ut-ie.com/b/b_flowers.html) that talks about the different roles in the writing process:

- **Madman** - full of ideas, jumbled thoughts and is where writing should start
- **Architect** - arranges the jumble into potential arguments, at the paragraph level
- **Carpenter** - sculpts the sentences into a logical structure to make better sense
- **Judge** - critical energy as the inspector and will check the facts of what is written

Applying these roles to my own writing revealed a crucial insight: that my writer's paralysis was me prematurely judging the madman before he could cook. I'd critisise the words, sentences, paragraph, headings, scope, purpose, before my madman even had a chance to shine. No wonder I got scared of writing, and wrote at a snail pace.

The madman within needs some air time; sometimes you just need a good ol' brain dump. Giving myself that permission totally freed me from the fear of writing. Nowadays, as soon as I feel myself being critical, I catch myself and think: "Is it time to judge yet?"

## Final points

To wrap up, here are some key takeaways about using AI as a writing companion:

1) The point of writing is the act itself; letting AI take over robs you of expressing your own voice and innate creativity.

2) I think AI LLMs are great companions for writing, but remember:
   - Ideally, keep personal information out of it
   - If you want to put personal information in, use temporary chats and disable model training ([more here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpt-privacy-tips-two-important-ways-to-limit-the-data-you-share-with-openai/))
   - Also check with your company before putting sensitive information or private IP like code into it

3) I wanted to share Derek Sivers blog [here](https://sive.rs/ai) that talks about his commitment to not use AI to generate text.

   > I have never ever used AI to generate text in place of my “voice”. No emails. No sentences in my articles or books or even comments. Nothing pretending to be me.
