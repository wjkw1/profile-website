I find myself with the luxury of relaxing in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and thinking about what the future looks like for me.

What do I want to do? Where do I want to be? Why am I doing whatever I'm doing?

I don't have a perfect answer to this, but I know that I can't let perfection stop the process. So let's focus on what I know:

- I want to lead myself toward some form of creative expression
- I have a proven capability to learn
- The internet compliments access to learning resources & community
- In this age of "AI", I can reduce feedback loops, fail-fast and experiment quickly
- I've always had an interest in music

I reckon it's time to learn how to make beats.

Ideally I would have documented my progress on social media (Instagram, TikTok, or other), but I fear opinions that might deter me from committing long-term.

So, I'm going to quietly post updates on here, mostly for me, but also for anyone who finds it. So bless you, whoever you are that's reading this.

**Good luck on your journey, and welcome to mine.**
