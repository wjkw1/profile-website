            <p class="italic">Updated in Chiang Mai, Thailand on 11th June 2025, from a Condo near the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai_Night_Bazaar">Night Bazaar</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="font-normal">Where am</h2>
            <p>I'm visiting countries abroad and will be traveling around Southeast Asia, learning languages,
                sightseeing, and thinking about the future.
            </p>
            <h2 class="font-normal">What do</h2>
            <p>I'm with my partner and we're doing a mixture of both travelling and vacationing‚Äîsee the difference
                explained <a href="https://wanderwisdom.com/Travel-Versus-Vacation">here</a>.</p>
            <p>We decided to take a break from the corporate ladder and try to reset our nervous systems. Wellness,
                routine, reading, exercising, researching, boredom, and finding new possibilities for what work could
                look like. We saved up and then finally stopped delaying our plans for an overseas experience.</p>
            <h2 class="font-normal">What intent</h2>
            <p>I like to call it "chasing the thread", I want to be free to choose which threads to pull i.e. what
                projects to pursue. That's what my mind tells me anyways, so I'm going to give myself 6-months doing
                this to discover if it's something that I truly want, or if it's something I thought I wanted.</p>

            <h2 class="font-normal">What focus</h2>
            <p>The focus is on learning how new AI tools can better serve, experiencing new cultures and learning new
                things in general. I'll focus in order of priority:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Routine (how-to while travelling üòÆ‚Äçüí®).</li>
                <li>Learning how to prompt and use the ever expanding belt of AI tools.</li>
                <li>Reading books like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368593.The_4_Hour_Workweek">The
                        4-hour Workweek by Tim Ferris</a>, see what I'm reading on <a
